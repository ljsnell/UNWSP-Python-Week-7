# Program #3: US_Population
# Have the user input (using a loop) various information that contains three pieces of data: 
# year, name of state, and population.  
# Store all of this information in a list of lists.  For example it might be stored like this:

# [[2010, "Maine", 1987435], [2010,"Minnesota",6873202], [2011, "Iowa", 3421988]]

# Now have the user enter a year.  The program will add the populations from all states in the list of list for that year only.
